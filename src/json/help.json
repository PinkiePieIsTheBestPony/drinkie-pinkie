            "Introduction": "This is necessary to explain how the rotation syntax works. The format of this rotation is very similar to a syntax used by a unix tool, called Cron. Here is an example - `2 4-6 5/10 4,8 *`. I will go through this.",
            "Example Explained": "`1st value (minutes [0-59]) - 2`: A single number is defined. Will run when the specified number time has been fully matched. Will post 2 minutes past the hour. \n`2nd value (hours [0-23]) - 4-6`: A range of numbers are defined. Will run when the specified number time is within the range. Will post every hour from 4 to 6am. \n`3rd value (days of month [1-31]) - 5/10`: Combination of multiples and a range of numbers. The first half represents the multiple value, which will only run if the number time fits within the multiple. The second half is a range, which defines what parts of the time are valid. Will post every 5th day, as long as the date is after the 10th of the month. \n`4th value (months [1-12]) - 4,8`: Multiple numbers are defined. Will run when one of the listed specified number times have been fully matched. Will post on April & August. \n`5th value (days of week [1-7]) - *`: Wildcard value, will run for every value. In this case, will post on any day of week.",
            "External Help": "If you're still confused, then contact this fella on Discord: Ponka#3440. Or try googling about Cron it might help since it can probably explain better."
